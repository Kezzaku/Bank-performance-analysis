## Usage

After running the application, you can access the dashboard in your web browser. The dashboard will provide options to select various KPIs and visualizations. Use the interactive features to explore the data.

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations that represent the banking data effectively. Some examples include:

- **Line Charts**: To show trends over time.
- **Bar Charts**: To compare different KPIs.
- **Pie Charts**: To illustrate market share.

These visualizations help stakeholders understand the data at a glance.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

In this project, we focus on several KPIs to measure banking performance:

1. **Return on Assets (ROA)**: Indicates how profitable a bank is relative to its total assets.
2. **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Measures the profitability of a bank in relation to shareholders' equity.
3. **Net Interest Margin (NIM)**: Shows the difference between interest income and interest paid, relative to interest-earning assets.
4. **Cost-to-Income Ratio**: Compares operating expenses to operating income, indicating efficiency.

These KPIs provide valuable insights into the bank's performance over the analyzed period.
